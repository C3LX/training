# Organization of this tutorial

We use this tutorial at C3LX (created by the folks at Catalyze.io) because we want something that we can distribute to all new hires to give them a crash course on HIPAA. There are many of HIPAA training options, but we feel that this program is the most applicable to modern health technology companies & vendors.

Each section below has multiple subsections, and there are links to additional resources at the end. There is a quiz towards the end, which is meant to force you to actively engage, and break up the passive nature of the training.
